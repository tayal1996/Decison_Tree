A Decision Tree classifier to predict which valuable employees will
leave next. You are tasked with helping in reducing the number of senior employees
leaving the company by predicting the next bunch. The fate of the company rests
in your hands. Download dataset here(http://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~murtuza.
bohra/decision_Tree.zip).
For each employee you are provided the following attributes:
1. Satisfaction Level
2. Last evaluation
3. Number of projects
4. Average monthly hours
5. Time spent at the company
6. Whether they have had a work accident
7. Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years
8. Departments
9. Salary
10. Whether the employee has left the company

1. Part-1: (30 points) Train decision tree only on categorical data. Report precision,
    recall, f1 score and accuracy.
2. Part-2: (30 points) Train the decision tree with categorical and numerical features.
    Report precision, recall, f1 score and accuracy.
3. Part-3: (10 points) Contrast the effectiveness of Misclassification rate, Gini, En-
    tropy as impurity measures in terms of precision, recall and accuracy.
4. Part-4: (10 points) Visualise training data on a 2-dimensional plot taking one fea-
    ture (attribute) on one axis and other feature on another axis. Take two suitable
    features to visualise decision tree boundary (Hint: use scatter plot with different
    colors for each label).
5. Part-5: (10 points) Plot a graph of training and validation error with respect to
    depth of your decision tree. Also plot the training and validation error with respect
    to number of nodes in the decision tree.
6. Part-6: (10 points) Explain how decision tree is suitable handle missing values(few
    attributes missing in test samples) in data.
