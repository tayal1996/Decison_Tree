*If data is from numerical column then we consider the average of entire column.
*If data is from categorical column then we consider the value those frequecy is maximum in that column.

*While predicting for a certain row and at a particular node we encounter missing value then will will traverse through every branch of that node and consider the result which will have more occurance.
